            <p>
                Most of today's widely accessible travel planning tools focus solely on two main functions: 
                logistics (e.g booking flights, accommodations) and destination content. The problem? Travel 
                <strong><em>should</em></strong> be an exciting and personable experience. For example, applications like Expedia and 
                Booking.com help organize itineraries, they lack the emotional engagement and personal reflection 
                that encapsulate a post-trip memory. On the other hand, social media platforms like Instagram and 
                TikTok capture snapshots of a person's itinerary and opinions, but they tend to be highly curated 
                and often lack genuine, personalized recommendations. This leaves users without a centralized, 
                interactive space to reflect on experiences and plan future travels based on personal preferences.

                shows that self-reflection via life-logging and visualization enhances informed decision-making 
                to help individuals progress towards their goals. More importantly, this reflection enriches overall 
                life-logging and makes for more personalized experiences. So for our project, we aim to address this current 
                gap in personable traveling and logistical planning. We hope to create a hub that has versatile functionalities 
                ranging from organizing future itineraries to self-reflection and logs. Our focus will be on user-generated insights, 
                thinking about questions like: What places did you love? How would you describe them? What kinds of experiences are 
                you drawn to? What did you dislike? and many more. Much of our inspiration came from the app
                <a href="https://beliapp.com/" target="_blank">Beli</a>, which tracks restaurants that users and friends visit, and 
                tailors recommendations based on personal preferences and friend activity. Our application intends to implement a similar 
                approach, but applying our domain to travel; planning doesn't <strong><em>have</em></strong> to be boring.
