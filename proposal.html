                <h2> Problem Description </h2>
                <p>Most of today's widely accessible travel planning tools focus solely on two main functions: logistics (e.g booking flights, accommodations) and destination content. The problem? Travel <strong><em>should</em></strong> be an exciting and personable experience. For example, applications like Expedia and Booking.com help organize itineraries, they lack the emotional engagement and personal reflection that encapsulate a post-trip memory. On the other hand, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok capture snapshots of a person's itinerary and opinions, but they tend to be highly curated and often lack genuine, personalized recommendations. This leaves users without a centralized, interactive space to reflect on experiences and plan future travels based on personal preferences.</p>
        
                <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01353?" target="_blank"> Research</a> shows that self-reflection via life-logging and visualization enhances informed decision-making to help individuals progress towards their goals. More importantly, this reflection enriches overall life-logging and makes for more personalized experiences. So for our project, we aim to address this current gap in personable traveling and logistical planning. We hope to create a hub that has versatile functionalities ranging from organizing future itineraries to self-reflection and logs. Our focus will be on user-generated insights, thinking about questions like: What places did you love? How would you describe them? What kinds of experiences are you drawn to? What did you dislike? and many more. Much of our inspiration came from the app <a href="https://beliapp.com/" target="_blank">Beli</a>, which tracks restaurants that users and friends visit, and tailors recommendations based on personal preferences and friend activity. Our application intends to implement a similar approach, but applying our domain to travel; planning doesn't <strong><em>have</em></strong> to be boring.</p>

                <h2> App Description </h2>
                <p>Ranging from solo travelers to families organizing group vacations, our web app targets users who are interested in planning and discovering destinations through notions of life-logging (e.g, having users record their experiences at destinations). This aims to support a wide variety of travel preferences overlooked by mainstream applications by giving users suggestions based on their own selection. Attractions and general “Things to do” owned by minority groups can also be highlighted and elevated through this website, as we want to contribute to more equitable visibility for underrepresented communities and destinations.</p>
                <section>
                    <p>We have several features that we hope will elevate the app:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A data collection feature where users can <strong>log and rate places</strong> they've visited by uploading photos, writing descriptions, and even add tags like “nature”, “group-friendly”, or “free to enter”.</li>
                        <li>Another feature will include users <strong>creating and organizing personalized trip lists</strong>, with the ability to invite other people to contribute adding additional information in the list.</li>
                        <li>Finally, adding a more social component by allowing users to view and filter trip lists, discover new destinations through community insights, and interact with the comments left on each review.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Together, these features can enhance the application to a more authentic travel planning experience where users can interact, collaborate, and explore destinations that feel more personal.</p>
                </section>
                <p>The information that the users will interact with user-generated content that includes trip logs, photos, ratings, and lists that users add. While we plan to have most data collected through user input, we are also potentially looking into using map display APIs such as <a href="https://www.tomtom.com/products/map-display-api/?utm_term=maps%20api&utm_campaign=1582_BUE_GLB_EN_SRC_Paid_AWR_PHR_All-Products&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=2791016231&hsa_cam=20498573000&hsa_grp=152511198363&hsa_ad=671689347347&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-389669140261&hsa_kw=maps%20api&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20498573000&gbraid=0AAAAADldm6g5MZ-GEsUohdRxVKu0YYnsU&gclid=CjwKCAjwsZPDBhBWEiwADuO6y-Bhbr_pWdihB2RdktVAKLyJhXz_L-43aJ6Lx4TKrRxZ78dD7UWsCBoCpmUQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">TomTom</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pm/location/?trk=3750bab4-dd7e-40bf-9f18-e14ed534c5a4&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjwsZPDBhBWEiwADuO6y9gPJB3STKIFAZR6yrQmuAFTZLXQi5DIfbOLHtD7HohvJ0bh7QcCiRoCbf0QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!652308004265!p!!g!!interactive%20maps%20tools!19870608864!147151614413&gad_campaignid=19870608864&gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp9AKzNvk5Ba8NwEcozh4Scv8&gclid=CjwKCAjwsZPDBhBWEiwADuO6y9gPJB3STKIFAZR6yrQmuAFTZLXQi5DIfbOLHtD7HohvJ0bh7QcCiRoCbf0QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">AWS Location Service</a>. This will pre-fill basic data of various locations to give the users a more seamless integration rather than starting from a blank state and manually entering everything themselves. Overall, our web application addresses the original problem we identified by giving users a more centralized and authentic space for organizing travel experiences.</p>
